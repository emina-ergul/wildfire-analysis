# wildfire-analysis

This project is being made to develop my use of numpy, pandas, and geopandas, as well as to familiarise myself with scientific data in order to learn and practice geospatial analysis.

Data source: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/ - NASA FIRMS public wildfire data
